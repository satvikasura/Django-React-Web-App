JWT has been used to establish user authentication for the website. User can create their profile and login to the website to store and manage their recipes (name, description, ingredients, process etc).

Backend: REST API endpoints have been created using Django REST Framework to register a user, generate a JWT token, refresh a JWT token, get the list of recipes for the current user, create a new recipe against the logged in user and delete a recipe. 

Frontend: Vite has been used for React project template and Axios for creating an HTTP client to invoke the REST endpoints.
